📚 Sentiment Analysis of Book Reviews

📌 Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on book reviews scraped from Books to Scrape.
The workflow involves web scraping, data preprocessing, sentiment classification (VADER), and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with interactive visualizations.
The goal is to understand how star ratings correlate with customer sentiment and uncover patterns in review length, word usage, and sentiment distribution.

⚙️ Tech Stack & Tools
Python (requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, nltk-VADER)
Data Visualization: Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Data Storage: CSV
Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔑 Features
Scraped 180+ book reviews with ratings (1–5 stars).
Converted star ratings (One–Five → 1–5 numeric).
Applied VADER sentiment analysis to classify reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
Generated compound sentiment scores for each review.
Performed EDA with:
Sentiment distribution across reviews
Compound scores vs star ratings (boxplots)
Review length analysis
Word frequency analysis (positive vs negative reviews)
Built interactive charts with Plotly for dynamic exploration.

📊 Key Insights
75% of 5-star reviews matched Positive sentiment classification.
1-star reviews were more often Negative and 2× longer on average.
Strong correlation between ratings and VADER sentiment scores.
Negative reviews highlighted issues like “poor quality”, “late delivery”, “waste”, while positive reviews emphasized “good”, “quality”, “great”.
